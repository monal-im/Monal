# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

It is highly appreciated to report a vulnerability to the Monal developers. We ask you for
disclosure until it has been fixed. This prevents abuse and exploitation in the current published releases.

Please report issues directly to info@monal-im.org. Feel free to put in CC: thilo+molitor@eightysoft.de

Please try to report 
- in detail what you are concerned about
- if applicable, how to reproduce
- your contact details, if the sending email is not enough. That way we can ask questions back to you. 

You are also invited to make a recommendation on how to fix a potential security vulnerability.

Once a vulnerability has been announced and indicated we try our very best to provide a fix as soon as possible,
at its best within days. However, dependent on the potential issue it can take longer if many code sections need to be changed.
Please be reminded that this is a non-commercial software project.

Thank you for considering to report a security vulnerability. This improves the quality of the app significantly.
