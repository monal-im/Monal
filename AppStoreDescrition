There has never been a better time to get into XMPP, a free public chat network that no one controls or owns. 
Monal is a fast and user friendly way to use the decentralized XMPP protocol (known as Jabber). Just download the app, login or register and you are ready 
to chat in minutes. Monal attempts to create a decent chat experience with XMPP in the Apple ecosystem.

Notable features:

- Open Source and free software (BSD 2-Clause License)
- No Ads! Strong focus on privacy. Monal does not track you and does not have data metric software 
included and does not read any personal information. 
- With the XMPP protocol a direct connection to your server ensures you can keep control of your data.
- Encrypted chat with OMEMO
- Monal will work with corporate XMPP servers that require a VPN
- MUC multi-user chat integration

The software is available on iOS and MacOS.
