## Donations and Support

Monal is developed by volunteers and community collaboration. The work which has been done is usually not paid and the developers ask for donations to keep up service costs and development in the future! Please consider to give a little bit back for the hard work which has been conducted. Currently there are three ways for financial support of the Monal development:

- Donate via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/tmolitor-stud-tu)
- Donate via [Libera Pay](https://liberapay.com/tmolitor)
- EU citizens can donate via SEPA, too. Just contact Thilo Molitor via mail to thilo@monal-im.org to get his IBAN.
